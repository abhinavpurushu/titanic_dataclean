# Titanic Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

## Project Overview
This project involves cleaning and preprocessing the Titanic dataset for machine learning purposes. The aim is to transform raw data into a clean and structured format by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, detecting and removing outliers, and normalizing numerical data.

## Dataset
Source: Titanic dataset from Kaggle.

## Files
Titanic_Dataset.csv: The original dataset.
titanic_cleaned.csv: The cleaned dataset.

## Usage
Used Python and the libraries ï»¿pandas, numpy, scikit-learn and seaborn in Jupyter Notebook.

## Results
Missing values in Age, Cabin, and Embarked were successfully handled.

Categorical variables were encoded, and numerical data was normalized.

Outliers were detected and removed.

Final cleaned dataset is saved as titanic_cleaned.csv
